# CS305 Module 5

I am working on a cryptocurrency trading bot. I will be using the Binance API and Python to create this bot.
There is no gauruntee this bot will create profit and is for educational purposes only.

## License
The License I will be using for this repo is: **GNU General Public License v3.0.**
This is because I am the most familiar with this License and I know it will keep
me out of trouble even though it's a school assignment.
