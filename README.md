# cs305_mod5

I am working on a libary of C functions and header files that will fit
any possible sitiation I get myself into. I have started with nodes and linked
lists, then I would move on to simple array manipulation just to stay fresh on the
simple topics. Then I want to branch out into more data structures funtions.

The licesnse I will be using for this repo is: GNU General Public License v3.0.
This is because I am the most familiar with this licesnse and I know it will keep
me out of trouble even though it's a school assignment.
