I am working on a cryptocurrency trading bot. I will be using the Binance API and Python to create this bot.
There is no gauruntee this bot will create profit and is for educational purposes only.

The licesnse I will be using for this repo is: GNU General Public License v3.0.
This is because I am the most familiar with this licesnse and I know it will keep
me out of trouble even though it's a school assignment.
